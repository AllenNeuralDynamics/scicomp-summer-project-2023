    "The difference between using rclone in Linux and Windows is that in Windows, you should *not* create the mount directory beforehand, and the daemon flag is not available so background process is realize by the ampersand. The config file path must be set manually by the flag `--config-file c:\\rclone\\rclone.conf` or by setting the environment variable `RCLONE_CONFIG`, as done in this demo. The `--no-console` flag can be used to hide the console that runs the rclone command, the user would then have to use `taskkill /F /IM rclone.exe` to kill all rclone instances. \n",
